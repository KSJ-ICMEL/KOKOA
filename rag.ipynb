On the one hand, the molecular dynamics trajectory\\nprovides an accurate atomist ic structure and its temporal\\nevolution, and on the other hand, the Monte Carlo part models\\nthe long-time motion of the acidic protons. Our hybrid approach\\ndeﬁnes a coupling scheme between the MD and kMC simulations\\nthat allows the kMC topology to adapt continuously to the\\npropagating atomistic microstructure of the system. On the\\nexample of a fuel cell membrane material, we validate our model by comparing its results with those of the pure MD simulation.\\nWe show that the hybrid scheme with an evolving topology results in a better description of proton diﬀusion than a conventional\\napproach with a static kMC transfer rate matrix. Furthermore, we show that our approach can incorporate additional dynamical\\nfeatures such as the coupling of the rotation of a side group in the molecular building blocks. In the present implementation, we\\nfocus on ion conduction, but it is straightforward to generalize our approach to other transport phenomena such as electronic\\nconduction or spin diﬀusion.\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\nAtomistic simulations of the structural parameters and the\\ndynamical behavior of complex materials can help to gain\\ninsight into the fundamental mechanisms of many mesoscopi-\\ncally observable phenomena. The direct simulation of\\nmesoscale properties, however, is often prohibitively resource-\\nintense and can only be achieved by means of advanced\\nsimulation techniques. Here, we present a scale-bridging\\napproach designed for the accurate description of ion transport\\nin condensed phases; we illustrate the performance of our\\nmethod on the example of proton conduction in proton\\nexchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).\\nAs the proton motion in fuel cell membranes involves the\\nbreaking of O−H bonds, methods must be applied that are able\\nto describe chemical reactions.\\nWhile Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches oﬀer a\\ngood compromise between an accurate modeling of chemical\\nbonds and universal applicability, their comparatively high\\ncomputational costs typically restrict them to time scales in the\\npicosecond range (see ref 1 for some benchmarks). Such time\\nscales, however, are far below those required to observe the\\nrelevant processes; e.g. regarding ion conduction, only few\\nelementary atomic hopping processes occur within a pico-\\nsecond.\\nIn order to overcome the temporal restrictions, we opted for\\na multiscale approach that combines a kinetic Monte Carlo\\nscheme with DFT based MD calculations.\\nThe combination of Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics in\\nmultiscale methods has been used before to simulate structure\\nand dynamics in the areas of solid state physics,\\n2−6 polymer\\nsciences,7−10 or biophysics for protein folding.11−13\\nIn theseﬁelds, numerous systems exhibit phenomena that are\\nseveral orders of magnitude slower than the elementary\\natomistic processes on which they rely. To cope with such\\ntime scale-crossing questions, diﬀerent types of combined MC/\\nMD methods were developed, which can be subdivided into\\nthree classes:\\n14\\nIn Mixed MD/MC algorithms, some atoms are modeled by\\nMD and the others by MC. LaBerge and Tully showed a\\ngenerally applicable way to build this kind of MD/MC\\nsystem.\\n15 Their Monte Carlo scheme uses a Metropolis\\nalgorithm16 to model the motion of selected atoms or\\nmolecules in the whole system.\\nHybrid MD/MC algorithms , on the other hand, apply a\\nscheme that moves the atoms both deterministically and\\nstochastically.

Its low computational costs allow us to\\nextend the time scales several orders of magnitude, i.e., from\\npicoseconds up to nano/microseconds. Its generality allows an\\neasy transfer to other systems and phenomena.\\n2. METHOD\\nIn order to reach mesoscales in a condensed phase system, we\\nidentify the parts (i.e., atomistic subsets) whose evolution takes\\nplace on a time scale not accessible for AIMD. Using a coarse-\\ngrained/simpliﬁed description by means of kMC for these slow\\nprocesses allows us to signi ﬁcantly increase the simulation\\nspeed, while still taking into account the atomistic structure and\\nits in ﬂuence on the kMC subsy stem. For an accurate\\ndescription of the dynamics, we build the kMC topology\\nfrom AIMD trajectories using a distance based approach.\\nIn the following, we clarify the crucial features of our MD/\\nkMC model. We explain the underlying Monte Carlo scheme\\nand how to determine its rate parameters, as well as the\\ninteraction between MD and kMC model.\\n2.1. Kinetic Monte Carlo Scheme.Propagation Scheme.\\nThe kMC model used here is based on the“Asymmetric Simple\\nExclusion Process” (ASEP).\\n40 In its most basic form, the model\\nconsists of a one-dimensional lattice, whose sites can each hold\\none particle. At each step, a connection between two\\nneighboring sites (i, i + 1) is chosen, and if sitei is occupied\\nand site i + 1 is empty, the particle will hop with probabilityp\\nto its right neighbor. It is straightforward to extend this model\\nto allow jumps in both directions by adding backward\\nconnections between all node pairs. In this case, a step consists\\nof choosing a connection (i,j), where j is either i +1o r i − 1,\\nand allowing a hop with probability p\\nij. Figure 1 shows an\\nexample of a one-dimensional lattice. To establish a particle\\nﬂow, either periodic boundary conditions are introduced (in\\nFigure 1 this would mean connecting node 7 with node 1) or\\nthe system is coupled to a reservoir, which introduces particles\\non one side with probability α and removes them from the\\nother end with probabilityβ.\\nIn order to describe an actual molecular system, an ASEP\\nmodel needs to be constructed, whose transfer rates and\\ntopological structure accommodate the characteristics of the\\nconsidered molecule. Clearly, the neighborhood of a single\\nnode cannot be determined as trivially as in the one-\\ndimensional example. As the linearity of the one-dimensional\\nchain is not given anymore, every possible site pair (i,j) needs\\nto be considered, and on the basis of the probabilityp\\nij for a\\njump between nodei and nodej, it has to be decided if a jump\\nwill take place. The choice of the jump probabilitiespij is crucial\\nfor the quality of our model. In section 3.2, we show a heuristic\\nmethod for their determination from AIMD simulations.\\nIteration Scheme and Time Step.Given the hopping rates\\nω\\nij for all node pairs (i, j) of a system, with\\nω = Δ\\np\\ntij\\nij\\n(1)\\na scheme must be chosen for the propagation of the particles.\\nWe use the random-sequential update,40 which iterates over the\\nnode pairs in a random order. This means that for each\\npropagation step a node pair (i,j) is chosen randomly, each pair\\nhaving the same chance to be drawn. IfN denotes the number\\nof nodes, on average, afterN(N − 1) steps every node pair (i,j)\\nwas considered for a jump with probabilityp\\nij. N(N − 1) steps\\nare called a sweep, and we link one sweep to the timeΔt, which\\nis determined by the hopping rates.\\n2.2. Coupling between Molecular Dynamics Simu-\\nlation and Monte Carlo Model.The most crucial aspect of\\nour model is the coupling between MD and the kMC\\nalgorithm, i.e. the way the kMC model obtains its topology\\nfrom the MD trajectory.\\nFor our method, aﬁrst-principles MD is performedﬁrst and\\nthen used as an input for the kMC model, which builds its rates\\nbased on the MD trajectory.\\nWe investigated three diﬀerent approaches: A Time-averaged\\nTopology Model (TTM), which works with an averaged kMC\\ntopology, a Continuous Topology Model (CTM), which\\nupdates the kMC topology after a number of MC steps from\\nthe structure of an existing AIMD trajectory. Furthermore, we\\nuse a Shuﬄed Topology Model (STM), which works similarly\\nto the CTM but draws the topologies from the trajectory in a\\nrandom order.\\nIn the following, each method will be explained in detail.\\nTime-Averaged Topology Model (TTM). The simplest\\nfashion in which the MD-based structures can be incorporated\\nwithin the kMC scheme is the use of an averaged topology and\\naveraged transfer rates obtained from the MD simulation. The\\ntransfer rate matrix is given by\\nFigure 1. Illustration of a simple kMC lattice in one dimension. The\\nparticle at node 3 is allowed to jump either to the left or to the right,\\nwhereas the particles at node 5 and node 6 hinder each other ’s\\nmovement.\\nJournal of Chemical Theory and Computation Article\\ndx.doi.org/10.1021/ct500482k | J.

AIMD Trajectories.We apply our MD/kMC model to\\na columnar supramolecular assembly consisting of eight 6(p-\\nphosphonatophenyl)benzene (p-6 PA-HPB) molecules. These\\nmolecules have a disk-like shape and exhibit phosphonic groups\\nat their edges. Because of their shape they arrange in hexagonal\\nstacks, forming channels that promote proton diﬀusion. This\\nmakes them well suited for use as PEM fuel cell membranes.\\nThe trajectories ofp-6 PA-HPB were run over a time scale of\\n30 ps at 400, 500, and 600 K.\\n41 We use these three trajectories\\nto build a heuristic model of our jump rates (see section 3.2)\\nand use the temporal change of the molecular topologies to\\nbuild a time-dependent transfer rate matrix for our kinetic\\nMonte Carlo model.\\n3.2. Determination of a Jump Rate from AIMD.We\\nwant to transfer the dynamic behavior of the protons in the\\nMD simulation onto our Monte Carlo model. Assuming a\\ndependence of the transfer rate solely on the donor−acceptor\\ndistance, i.e.\\nωω= d()ij ij (5)\\nwe evaluate the proton transfer rate between oxygen pairs at\\ndiﬀerent distances:\\n1. At time t, count the number of oxygen pairsNox(d,t)a ta\\ndistance d (or more precisely within an interval [d − Δd/\\n2, d + Δd/2]) that may be possible candidates (i.e. all\\ndonoracceptor pairs).\\n2. At time t + Δt, determine the number of jumpsNjump(d,t\\n+ Δt) that occurred between them.\\nThe quotient Njump(d,t + Δt)/Nox (d,t) will then give the\\nprobability for a jump if two oxygens are a distanced apart. We\\nchose a binwidthΔd = 0.01 Å for the resulting histogram. By\\naveraging this ratio over the whole trajectory, a distribution (see\\nFigure 2. Thus, weﬁt it accordingly via\\nω =\\n+ −\\n()\\nd a()\\n1e x p db\\nc (6)\\nThe resulting ﬁt parameters can be found in Table 1. As the\\ntransfer rate describes the probability of a proton jump between\\ntwo successive frames, its temporal unit is determined by the\\ntime step of the trajectory.\\nIn Figure 2, the resulting transfer rates are plotted (including\\nthe curves of the Fermiﬁt as straight lines). A similar behavior\\nfor all three temperatures can be seen. At larger distances, the\\nFermi curve’s tail increases with temperature and therefore\\npromotes long-range proton transfer.\\nFigure 2.

The reason for this is that\\nboth the number of proton jumps and the number of oxygen\\npairs at this distance is very small. Therefore, only a few\\nhopping events can be sampled there.\\nSymmetry of the Transfer Rate Matrix.The ASEP method\\nmentioned before allows connections between two nodesi and\\nj such that the probability for a jump fromi to j, p\\nij, and the\\nprobability for a jump back,pji, are diﬀerent. In other words, it\\nis possible to construct an asymmetric transfer rate matrix.\\nOur choice to determine the transfer rate by a distance\\ndependent function ensures a symmetric transfer rate function,\\nthough. This is due to the fact that the distance matrixd\\nij is\\nsymmetric, and therefore ωij = ω(dij) must be symmetric as\\nwell.\\n3.3. Activation Energy of a Proton Jump. While the\\njump rates obtained in section 3.2 show a similar behavior from\\n400 to 600 K, a more thorough examination reveals a slight\\nincrease of the jump rate with temperature. This temperature\\ndependence is reﬂected by the Arrhenius equation\\nω =− ⎜⎟\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎞\\n⎠A E\\nRTexp a\\n(7)\\nwhich allows us to determine the activation energy fromω via\\nω=− ∂\\n∂()\\nEd R d() (ln( ( )))\\nT\\na 1\\n(8)\\nThe result in Figure 3 shows that the activation energy stays\\nlow at oxygen distances below 2.4 Å but rises quickly afterward.\\nWe ﬁtted the data in the range from 2.24 to 2.58 Å with an\\nexponential function\\n=+Ed a d b() e x p ( )a (9)\\nwith a = 12.4 Å−1 and b = −30.3.\\nFor a typical O−O distance in a hydrogen bond between 2.5\\nand 2.6 Å, the resulting activation energy is then between about\\n2 and 7 kcal/mol. This is on the same order of magnitude as\\nthe energy barrier of proton transfer in liquid water.\\n42\\n3.4. Topological Adjustments. In order to describe the\\nproton transport inp-6 PA-HPB well, the purely distance-based\\napproach needed to be modiﬁed slightly. This is due to the fact\\nthat no proton jumps are observed between oxygens within the\\nsame phosphonic group, although the distance-based criterion\\nwould allow them. Therefore, all edges between such oxygens\\nwere manually set to zero. Especially in anisotropic systems,\\ncare must be taken not to allow proton transfer between\\noxygens that do not show proton transfer in the DFT\\ntrajectory.\\n3.5. Proton Dynamics in a Nondriven Setting. We\\ncompared our MD/kMC model with original DFT trajectories\\n(see section 3.1), which consisted of a fully periodic system of\\neight p-6 PA-HPB disks arranged in two layers. Both AIMD\\nand kMC model hold a total number of 96 protons.\\nIn order to verify that the MD/kMC model ’s dynamic\\nbehavior shows a reasonable agreement with the original AIMD\\nresults, we compare the evolution of the covalent bond\\nautocorrelation function and the mean square displacement\\n(MSD) for the diﬀerent models.\\nBoth for the autocorrelation function of the covalent bonds\\nand the MSD, the MD/kMC hybrid results were averaged over\\n100 disjunct intervals, whereas the MD trajectory was averaged\\nover 20 overlapping intervals.\\nEvolution of Covalent Bonds. In order to quantify the\\nproton dynamics within the molecular system, we observe the\\nchange of covalent bonds between oxygens and protons over\\ntime. For this, we deﬁne a vectorH(t), which, for each acidic\\nproton in the system at timet, holds the index of its covalent\\nbonding partner. In the case of the AIMD trajectories, we store\\nthe indices of each proton’s nearest oxygen neighbor, whereas\\nfor the MD/kMC model, the indices of the oxygen sites at\\nwhich the protons are residing, are saved.\\nThe quantity\\n∑η δ=⟨ ⟩ +t()\\ni\\nHt Ht t tcov () , ( )ii\\ncov\\n0\\ncov\\n0 0\\n(10)\\nreduces the multidimensional vectorH(t) to a scalar value by\\ncounting the covalent bondings that have not changed since\\ntime t\\n0.\\nThe progress ofηcov(t) is shown in Figure 4a−c. While the\\nkinetic Monte Carlo models show qualitatively a similar\\ndevelopment of η\\ncov(t) to the AIMD, the kMC models decay\\nfaster than the AIMD simulation. But we can also observe that\\nthe CTM stays closest to the AIMD, whereas TTM and STM\\nshow a very similar decay whose diﬀerence to the AIMD clearly\\ngrows with increasing temperature.\\nIn order to explain the diﬀerent dynamic behavior of the\\nMD/kMC models, one has to keep in mind how each model’s\\ntopology changes over time and how this aﬀects the proton\\npaths. Whenever two oxygen atoms are closer than around 2.4\\nÅ, the ﬁtted step function (see Figure 2) shows a relevant\\nhopping probability. Jumps to more distant oxygen atoms on\\nthe other hand are very unlikely. Because of the smoothly\\nchanging topology of the CTM, new proton paths will only\\nappear after some time. The TTM on the other hand, provides\\nmany possible proton paths for each oxygen at every time step\\nbecause of its time averaged connectivity matrix. This increases\\nthe mobility of each proton and leads to a stronger decline of\\nη\\ncov(t).\\nIn the case of the STM, the observed behavior depends on\\nthe number of sweeps used between two topology updates.\\nWhile we used a number of 75 sweeps for the results presented\\nhere, we could observe that a variation of the number of sweeps\\nresults in either a behavior similar to the TTM (if a small sweep\\nnumber is used) or one similar to the CTM for large sweep\\nnumbers. This behavior is reasonable, as a small topology\\nupdate interval results in quickly changing proton paths, which\\npromotes a fast change of the covalent bondings.

Although the MD/kMC model allows us to sample\\nthe MSD over larger intervals than for the AIMD simulations,\\nwe restrict them to 10 ps atﬁrst, for a direct comparison.\\nIn Figure 5a−c, the MSD is shown for the three Monte Carlo\\nmodels and the AIMD simulation. At all three temperatures,\\nthe Monte Carlo models show a higher MSD than the AIMD,\\nwith the STM having the largest MSD, followed by the TTM\\nand the CTM. The overestimation of the Monte Carlo models\\nis due to the fact that the minimal distance a kMC proton can\\ntravel is the distance between two neighboring oxygens. This\\nincreases the distance of a proton jump by about 2 Å (if we\\nassume that a hopping proton in the AIMD keeps a distance of\\n1 Å to its covalent bonding partners). Consequently, the MSD\\nis overestimated at short time scales but levels in the long run.\\nIn the next step, we take the conductivity obtained from the\\nAIMD as a reference and compare the conductivities of the\\nkMC models, sampled over an interval of 150 ps, with it. We\\ndetermine the diﬀusion constant D via\\n⟨ +− ⟩ =tt t D trr(( ) ( ) ) 6 t00\\n2\\n0 (11)\\nby ﬁtting the slope of the MSD from 20 to 150 ps.

We expect the same behavior for the AIMD.\\nTherefore, the following comparison should only be considered\\nas a trend of the kMC models with respect to the AIMD.\\nThe diﬀusion constants of the kMC models show a smaller\\nconductivity for 400 and 500 K than the AIMD. At 400 K, the\\nconductivities of all three models are about 30% of the AIMD’s\\nconductivity.

At 600 K, both TTM and STM\\nshow a conductivity about 2 times as high as that of the AIMD\\n(TTM, 225%; STM, 170%). The conductivity of the CTM, in\\ncontrast, stays below the AIMD’s conductivity (75%).\\nWe see that the diﬀerence between the kMC models strongly\\nvaries with temperature. While at low temperatures, all three\\nmodels behave very similarly, their behavior diverges with\\nincreasing temperature. Only the CTM stays close to the\\nAIMD, whereas TTM and STM strongly overestimate the\\nMSD.\\nJump Rates.We compare the dynamics of the original DFT\\nsimulation and our MD/kMC model by counting the jumps of\\nthe 96 protons occurring in the MD/kMC model and in the\\nMD trajectory and dividing them by the time each system was\\nmeasured. The comparison shows that the total number of\\njumps observed within 1 ps in the MD/kMC models is about a\\nquarter of that of the MD trajectory. This ratio stays almost\\nconstant with varying temperature.\\nAs Table 2 shows, the numbers of proton jumps that can be\\nobserved in the MD/kMC models do not match those of the\\nAIMD exactly. But this is not surprising, as ourﬁt function used\\nfor the determination of the jump rates (Figure 2) is only a\\nheuristic approximation, which, especially for small oxygen\\ndistances, lacks accuracy, which is caused by the small sampling.\\nFurthermore, a model error is introduced by describing the\\nproton dynamics solely through the ASEP model (section 2.1).\\nThus, we think that the results are still in good agreement with\\nthe original AIMD outcome.\\n3.6. MD/kMC in a Driven Setting. We examine the\\nproton conduction behavior ofp-6 PA-HPB in a driven setting.\\nFor this, we set up our system such that four stacks, each with\\n10 molecules, form proton channels along the z axis. The\\nsystem is periodic inx and y directions, and a protonﬂux along\\nthe z axis is triggered by a reservoir, which couples to the\\nmolecular system through two sinusoidal functionsα(z) and\\nβ(z).\\nα λ π=+ −\\n⎜⎟\\n⎡\\n⎣⎢\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎤\\n⎦⎥z zz() 1\\n2 1c o s min\\n(13)\\nwith zmin ≤ z ≤ zmin + λ and\\nβ λ π=+ −\\n⎜⎟\\n⎡\\n⎣⎢\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎤\\n⎦⎥z zz() 1\\n2 1c o s max\\n(14)\\nwith zmax − λ ≤ z ≤ zmax.\\nWhile on one side protons are added with the probability\\nα(z) per time step (see Figure 6, bottom picture on the left),\\nthey are withdrawn on the other side with the probabilityβ(z).\\nWe set the parameter λ, which deﬁnes the depth of proton\\ninsertion and proton withdrawal to 6 Å.\\nIn order to describe the protonﬂux in the case of a coupled\\nreservoir, we use a collective coordinateRz(t) that sums up the\\nvectorial distances the protons in the system cover over time.\\n∫ ∑=′ Δ ′\\n∈ ′\\nR tt r t() d ( )z\\nt\\npS\\nzp0 ,\\nt (15)\\nSt denotes the set of protons that are found in the system at\\ntime t, and Δrz,p(t) is the distance proton p moves at time t\\nalong the z axis.\\nThis quantity can be used to quantify the overall proton\\nmovement through the system.\\nWith the setting described above, we investigate the proton\\nconduction along the columnar direction of our system.\\nInﬂuence of the PO(OH)2 Rotations. We want to determine\\nwhich in ﬂuence an increase of the rotation rates of the\\nphosphonic groups of our test system has on the proton\\nconductivity. For this, we deﬁne a rotation event in the Monte\\nCarlo model, which swaps protons residing in one phosphonic\\ngroup cyclically with a rateω\\nrot.\\nFigure 7 shows the resulting variations in protonﬂux when\\nthe probability for a phosphonic group’s rotation is increased.\\nThe kMC model used here is the CTM.\\nWhen plotting the slope ofRz over ωrot (Figure 7), it can be\\nobserved that for all three temperatures the proton motion in\\nthe z direction increases upon increasing rotation frequencies.\\nAt 600 K, higher rotation rates show a greater inﬂuence on the\\nproton ﬂux, whereas both the 400 K and the 500 K curves get\\nclose to a plateau nearω\\nrot = 0.01 fs−1.

In order to gain insight into the spatial\\nproton distribution as a result of the connected proton\\nreservoir, the average occupation density of the oxygen sites\\nwas plotted in Figure 8a−c, i.e. the ratio of protons found and\\navailable oxygen sites in an interval along the z axis.

At 500 K, the plateau has\\nalmost completely vanished, and at 600 K the densities of all\\nthree models diminish linearly from source to drain.\\n4. CONCLUSION\\nWe developed a hybrid MD/kMC approach using a kinetic\\nMonte Carlo scheme whose topology dynamically adapts to the\\natomistic structure of an MD trajectory. The hybrid scheme is\\ncapable of taking the atomistic structure into account while still\\nallowing to extend the time scales by several orders of\\nmagnitude.\\nA heuristically determined hopping rate function allows us to\\nbuild kMC topologies based on the molecular structure of\\ncomplex underlying systems.\\nWe tested diﬀerent approaches to link the Monte Carlo\\nmethod with the AIMD, using a model with aﬁxed topology\\nand ﬁxed transfer rates, a dynamic model that updates its\\nunderlying oxygen topology after ﬁxed kMC steps with\\nrandomly drawn states from the AIMD trajectory and a\\ndynamic model that updates the oxygen topologies sequentially\\nfrom the AIMD trajectory. While all three models show\\nqualitatively similar results, the CTM showed the best\\nagreement with the AIMD results, whereas both TTM and\\nSTM overestimate the decay of covalent bondings and the\\nMSD in a direct comparison. However,ﬁne-tuning of the kMC\\ntime of the STM can yield results similar to the CTM.\\nA particularly noteworthy aspect of our method is that the\\nproton dynamics can be well described by a function of the\\ndistance that depends only on three parameters. Compared to\\nother scale-briding methods, the ease of use is a big advantage\\nand makes our method ideal for aﬁrst estimation of the proton\\nconduction properties in molecular systems. Furthermore, the\\nease of manipulating the underlying structure allows one to\\nfathom how changes in the network of proton paths will alter\\nthe overall behavior of the conductivity. As an example, we\\nshowed how the rotational coupling of the side groups\\ninﬂuences the overall proton conductivity.\\nNevertheless, there are still shortcomings that need to be\\naddressed in the future. The extraction ofω(d) from an MD\\ntrajectory is nontrivial due to the diﬃculty of determining the\\nexact cause of a proton jump. For a more exact hopping rate,\\nfurther parameters, such as the angle between the functional\\ngroups should be taken into account. Furthermore, our model\\nneglects long-range correlations between the excess protons. In\\nparticular, the hopping rate of a proton should be inﬂuenced by\\nthe occupation numbers of the nearby oxygens. At the moment,\\nonly the exclusion principle of the ASEP is applied. Finally, our\\nmodel lacks feedback from the kMC algorithm to the MD so\\nfar. Therefore, the MD structure will not adapt to the current\\nproton occupation in the kMC model.\\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\n*S Supporting Information\\nJump rates in the AIMD trajectory, ﬁt parameters of the\\ncovalent bond autocorrelation, di ﬀusion constants of the\\nnondriven setting.

      "Assistant: Hello! It's good to connect with someone interested in reasoning and science. How can I assist you today? 😊\n",
      "Assistant: Okay, let's delve into Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. It's a powerful method for simulating systems where events occur randomly over time, governed by stochastic processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it as a way to \"play out\" the probabilities of different things happening in a system, step-by-step, keeping track of the time it takes for each event.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Monte Carlo (MC) Method:** At its core, Monte Carlo is a computational technique that uses random sampling to solve problems or simulate systems. It relies on repeated random draws to estimate numerical results or model complex behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **\"Kinetic\" Aspect:** This differentiates KMC from other types of Monte Carlo simulations (like some for numerical integration or optimization). The \"kinetic\" part refers to the fact that the system involves processes with specific *rates* at which events occur. These rates are often derived from underlying physical principles (like transition state theory in chemistry or statistical mechanics).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Stochastic Processes:** KMC deals with systems where the future is not deterministic but probabilistic. The exact time and sequence of events are uncertain, but governed by statistical laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **The Core Idea:**\n",
      "    *   **Identify Events:** In the system you want to simulate, what are the possible things that can happen (the \"events\")? Examples: An atom jumping from one site to another on a surface, a molecule reacting, a defect forming in a crystal.\n",
      "    *   **Assign Rates:** For each possible event, you need a rate constant (often denoted as `k_i`) that tells you *how likely* that event is to occur *per unit time*, given the current state of the system. These rates are usually much smaller than 1, reflecting the low probability of events happening in a given instant.\n",
      "    *   **Random Selection:** At the current time, you randomly select *which* event will occur next. The probability of selecting a particular event `i` is proportional to its rate `k_i`. This is often done using techniques like the roulette wheel selector or cumulative distribution functions.\n",
      "    *   **Calculate Time Step:** Once an event is selected, you need to know *when* it will happen. Since the events are random, the time `Δt` until the next event follows an *exponential distribution*. The average time for the selected event `i` is `1 / k_i`. The actual time step `Δt` is calculated randomly based on this average.\n",
      "    *   **Update State:** The selected event occurs. This changes the state of the system. You then update all the rate constants `k_i` because the system is now in a different state, and the rates might have changed.\n",
      "    *   **Repeat:** Go back to step 3 and continue the simulation until you reach a desired total simulation time or have observed enough events.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Mathematical Foundation (Briefly):**\n",
      "    *   The probability of event `i` occurring in a small time interval `dt` is `k_i * dt`.\n",
      "    *   The probability that *no event* occurs in `dt` is `exp(-Σk_i * dt)`.\n",
      "    *   The probability that *only event i* occurs in `dt` is `k_i * dt * exp(-Σk_j * dt)`.\n",
      "    *   As `dt` approaches zero, the probability of an event occurring in `dt` is small, and the time until the next event follows an exponential distribution with rate `Σk_i` (the sum of all individual rates). The probability density function for the time `t` until the next event is `f(t) = Σk_i * exp(-Σk_i * t)`. The selected event `i` is then responsible for this time with probability `k_i / Σk_j`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Key Advantages:**\n",
      "    *   **Time is Determined by Events:** Unlike some other simulation methods (like molecular dynamics which use fixed time steps), KMC naturally adapts the time step to the relevant timescales of the events happening in the system. This makes it much more efficient for systems where events are rare.\n",
      "    *   **Focus on Probabilities:** It directly simulates the stochastic nature of the system based on known transition probabilities (rates).\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Common Applications:**\n",
      "    *   Surface diffusion and catalysis\n",
      "    *   Chemical reaction kinetics\n",
      "    *   Materials science (e.g., thin film growth, defect formation)\n",
      "    *   Radiation damage accumulation\n",
      "    *   Nucleation and growth processes\n",
      "    *   Cell biology (protein interactions)\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:** Kinetic Monte Carlo is a computational technique for simulating systems with inherent randomness and probabilistic event occurrences over time. It uses random number generation to select which event happens next and calculates the time until that event based on the system's reaction rates, updating the system state afterwards. It's particularly powerful for studying processes where time and randomness play crucial roles, like diffusion or chemical reactions at surfaces.\n"
